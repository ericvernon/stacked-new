Dataset:     ILPD (Indian Liver Patient Dataset)
Abstract:    Death by liver cirrhosis continues to increase, given the increase in alcohol consumption rates, chronic hepatitis infections, and obesity-related liver disease. Notwithstanding the high mortality of this disease, liver diseases do not affect all sub-populations equally. The early detection of pathology is a determinant of patient outcomes, yet female patients appear to be marginalized when it comes to early diagnosis of liver pathology. 
The dataset comprises 584 patient records collected from the NorthEast of Andhra Pradesh, India.
The prediction task is to determine whether a patient suffers from liver disease based on the information about several biochemical markers, including albumin and other enzymes required for metabolism.
